FAQ
---

### What is the OME?
The Online Markdown Editor ( currently only an advanced viewer ) renders any Markdown File on Github as documentation with navigation index.

### How does the OME work?
The OME renders markdown in a manner that is best suited for Documentation ( originally built for API Documentation ). While rendering, `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` headers are pulled and rendered as a mobile friendly index to the left of the original rendered markdown.

There are plans to build out an inline editor that allows documentation to be updated within the editor without leaving the rendered markdown.  This will make keeping Great Documentation incredibly easy, especially for Open Source Projects.

### Why was it built?
The OME grew from an internal project where we were rendering our company's API Documentation from a Markdown File.  We realized how simple this was to maintain, and saw it allow us to effortlessly maintain Great Documentation.

We found that we simply didn't update our Docs frequently enough when trying to maintain documentation outside our project, in multiple linked files within Github, or any number of proprietary SaaS apps.

WIth the OME, you can maintain even very large documentation files ( our API Docs are over 50 pages now ) within the project rep, using your favorite text editor.

This is the easiest way we can imagine maintaining Great Documentation.

### Are private files secure?
Yes. Learn more in the Security section below.
